# RUSTY

A small Rust playground for learning and experimenting at a systems level.

This repository contains multiple **independent Rust projects**, each living in its own folder. The goal is to learn Rust by building small tools and utilities from scratch.

## Projects

- guessing_game — terminal number guessing game
- pwd-gen-rater — password generator with strength rating
- radix-base-convertor — number base / radix converter
- dfa-lexer — table-driven lexical analyzer (no regex, no crates)

Each folder is a standalone Cargo project.

## Run

cd <project>
cargo run

This repo is a learning sandbox, not a production library.
